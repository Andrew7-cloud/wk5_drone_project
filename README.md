# Flask Drone Collection API Reference

The Drone Collection API will be segmented based on the day of the week. Where needed there may also be different brances for seperate sessions as well (Morning/Afternoon).

The full project will be presented on the master branch for those who would like to see the full code at the end. However, each day will be a particular branch for the repo.
